## Bugs
- Mild stability issues still
- ~~Objects appear to be sliding when they should be stationary - seems like dodgy contact points~~
- ~~Sometimes objects disappear~~
- ~~Broad Phase bug with too many objects~~

## Features
### Next
- ~~Position correction~~
- ~~Impulse accumulation~~
- ~~Warm starting~~
- More interesting examples/tests
- Joints
- Extend to circles

### Nexter
- Continuous collision detection
- Ray casting

### Nextest
- Soft bodies
