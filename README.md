# Lambda2D - Rigid Body Physics (Possibly Soft Body in the future)
![Lambda2D_logo@0 5x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45016299/124357647-98720d00-dc14-11eb-8323-67c47293f208.png)
## Bugs
- Mild stability issues
- ~~Objects appear to be sliding when they should be stationary - seems like dodgy contact points~~
- ~~Sometimes objects disappear~~
- ~~Broad Phase bug with too many objects~~

## Features
### Next
- Extend to circles
- Joints
- Tree balancing for more efficient broadphase
- ~~Position correction~~
- ~~Impulse accumulation~~
- ~~Warm starting~~

### Nexter
- Continuous collision detection
- Ray casting

### Nextest
- Soft bodies
